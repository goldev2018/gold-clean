						<p><strong>LNG Hub Terminal</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>We are the 100% owner and developer of the Philippines first ever LNG Hub terminal, which we consider to be a strategically important asset for the Philippines nascent gas industry</li>
								<li>The Hub Terminal is 130,000 m3 and will be used as an import / export facility </li>
								<li>Facility is capable of handling up to 3 mtpa of LNG per year, which can support up to 3,000 MW of gas fired power plants</li>
								<li>Deep water jetty can handle all sizes of LNG vessels</li>
								<li>The Hub Terminal will support our adjacent 650 MW combined cycle gas fired power plant, and provide expansion options for both EWC and third party gas clients</li>
								<li>Hub Terminal to be run on a tolling model for third party clients</li>
